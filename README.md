# 2DGeometryMaze

## Synopsis

Simple and lazy maze game made in less than a week for an Android class.
The player controls a ball across a maze using its phone's gyroscops.
He can also alternate between two "realities", each reality having specific walls.

The faster the player reach the goal, and the lesser he switches between realities, the higher is score is.
